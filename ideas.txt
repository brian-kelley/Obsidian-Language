Onyx Language Features (language, not compiler)

Casting never needed, have implicit conversion work on any primitive or compound type (arrays), and even that should be avoided in the compiler

Testing features: test as more powerful assert()
-test(aFunction(input), goldStandard); ///// assert equality of two expressions, but is written as the first thing inside a function
Put test(a, b) in global scope to do the test at (debug build) compile time, and inside to do whenever the func/proc is run (compile-time or run-time)
All tests are left out of release builds
