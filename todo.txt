---------------------
      TODO:
---------------------
-Make backend work
  -Don't try to avoid data structure copies (do that later but still in un-optimized build)
  -All statements, all data structures
  -Initialization of globals and struct members
  -Tests
  -Test compiler thoroughly: correct operation and no leaks
-Implement #include (a special built-in metaprocedure)

-Build data dependency graph (for now, only within subroutines)
  -for each basic block, find the inputs
-Constant propagation and compile-time evaluation of expressions
  -finish and use the interpreter
-Build CFG of each subroutine
  -Liveness analysis

-Add keyword include
  -check that is inside static module
  -read file (if that fails, give informative message)
  -lex and insert tokens at current position
  -maintain list of integer file IDs
    -store these in AST nodes along with line/col
    -included files should remember where they were included (create a tree)
  -include should be idempotent (doing it again with same file is no-op)
    -don't even need to read the file after first time, just find path in table
-Implement external functions in backend
-Implement overloading
  -Name::SUBROUTINE needs to be changed to refer to all subrs with same name
  -can't overload on return type alone
  -all overloads must be in the same scope
    -subrs with same name but diff scope shadows instead
  -when resolving calls, choose first version with exact type match,
    then the first one (lexically) that matches
-Implement generic keyword (see below)
  -generic is just another kind of ScopedDecl (and Name)
-Add punctuation for meta: @ $ @> $>
-In parser, add hook for meta statements (see a # means parse & exec stmt/decl)
-At this point, core (non-meta) language is 100% done
  -so finish the interpreter

-Allow subroutine overloading
-This is so that calling with union argument(s) will dynamic dispatch to the correct version for contents IF version taking the exact union directly doesn't exist
  -To find matching subr, take first found where arguments exactly match,
  then where arguments are convertible (lex order breaks ties)

-Parse tree/AST merge refactoring
  -Parsing a nonterminal should do all possible semantic checking given incomplete context
  -Add virtual void check() to nonterminal, which does the full context sensitive semantic checking
  -metaStatement() will call check() during parsing, since full semantics of statement must be known immediately
  -after parsing, regular parse tree will be traversed in order and check() will be called on each node

-Metaprogramming:
  -Put '#' before any pseudo-statement (scoped decls and regular statements)
    -A scoped decl after # must be variable or subroutine
      (all other scoped decls must exist in both meta world and regular program)
    -Meta-variables are different kind of name than (normal scoping applies)
    -Meta-subroutines can contain $/@-statements, regular ones can't
      -they can still be represented as Subroutine, just add 'meta' bool
    -Meta-statements are run at compile time (have no presense in final C/machine code output)
  -#define <identifier> "..."; works just like C
    -don't need function-like macros because meta-procs can do everything they do
  -Implicit conversion from string to any AST node type is parsing

  -New syntax rules:
  * (any):                #<stmt>: execute meta-stmt or create meta-decl
  * (stmt in meta-subr):  @<expr>: evaluate expr at compile time, expr must be string, and output lex(expr) to code stream
  * (stmt in meta-subr):  $<expr>: evaluate expr at compile time, and output it to code
  * $> <expr> and @> <expr> append tokens to end of code, not current position
      * for values, create equivalent literal (ALL values can be represented as primitive or compound literals)
      * for AST elements, unparse back to tokens

  //Example: do10(b) generates a loop that runs b 10 times
  #proc void do10(Block b)
  {
    @"for i : 0,10";
    $b;
  }

  //This is a fully functional "include",
  //although real compiler should have #include
  //built in so that file/line/col works with multiple files
  //also, should actually include each file once, even if #included
  //multiple times
  #proc void include(string fname)
  {
    string text = readFile(fname);
    @text;
  }

  //C++ style generics (but with code size reduction option)
  //need keyword "generic"
  //example syntax:
  generic(T)
  func int serialSize(T val)
  {
    return serialize(val).len;
  }

  //compiler could implement by fully instantiating the decl for every type,
  //or by creating a single decl that has a union that covers all uses
  //suppose program uses:
  serialSize(int)(6);
  serialSize(string)("omgwtfbbq");
  serialSize(byte[])([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

  //there could be represented in final code by:
  func int serialSize_int__(int val)
  func int serialSize_string__(string val)
  func int serialSize_byte_arr__(byte[] val)

  //OR as:
  //argument is implicitly converted to exact match in union,
  //and if return value is a T union then extract the real value
  func int serialSize((int | string | byte[]) val)
  {
    match v : val
    {
      case int:
        return serialize(v).len;
      case string:
        return serialize(v).len;
      case byte[]:
        return serialize(v).len;
    }
  }

-----------------------------------
   After core language compiler:
-----------------------------------
BUILT-IN MODULES (all must be fully cross-platform)
  -Term (stdin/stdout/formatting/parsing, commands)
  -Sys (File I/O, filesystem, sockets, time)
  -GL (4.1+), plus some nice utilties, like:
    -GLM-style math
    -OBJ model loading
    -Shader utilities
    -Mesh utilities (half-edge structure, loading, saving)
  -Font (Unicode support, antialiasing)
  -Input (keyboard, mouse, gamepad - portable across all machines)
    -Want to be able to poll keys/buttons efficiently like SDL,
      or set callbacks for specific events
    -callbacks are dead simple with first-class subrs
  -UI (like libUI)
    -should call native Win32/Cocoa/ GTK? for native look and feel
  -Native audio wrapper
  -set(T) in global, implemented as (T : void)
  -Compression, for use with serialization: Zstd? (speed > compression)
  -Graph
    -Directed and not
    -Dijkstra's algo for single source reachability/distance
    -Kosaraju's algo for strongly connected components
    -topological sort
    -Prim's algo for minimum spanning tree
  -Codec: ffmpeg wrappers
