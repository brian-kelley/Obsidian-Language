TODO:
---------------------
-Unified name searching
  -Prevent one name for multiple kinds of things
  -Subroutine overloading is still OK
-Simplify and fix type loading

---------------------

LANGUAGE BUILT-IN MODULES (all must be fully cross-platform - "just work" with a clean Onyx installation):
  -Term (stdin/stdout/formatting/parsing, commands)
  -Sys (File I/O, filesystem, sockets, time)
  -Modern OpenGL, plus some nice utilties, like:
    -GLM-style math
    -OBJ model loading
    -Shader utilities
    -Mesh utilities (loading, saving, refinement, decimation)
  -Font rendering (full TrueType/Unicode support)
  -Input (keyboard, mouse, gamepad - portable across all machines)
  -UI (nice libUI interface, or something similar from scratch?)
  -OpenAL (audio)
  -zlib (compression)
  -Graphs (nice data structure, shortest path, finding cycles, reachability, etc)
