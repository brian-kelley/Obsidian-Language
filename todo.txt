---------------------
      TODO:
---------------------
FRONTEND
-Add function overloading
  -Scope "subroutine" names should be a set of overloads,
    which are matched during call resolution

-using directives
  -introduces either one name into the current modules, or
   all names in another module.
  -Ambiguous usage is an error
  -Change shadowing rules: allow names in module scope to shadow without warning,
   but never allow block names to shadow a visible name.

-(WIP) AST interpreter for core language (prerequisite)
-extern functions:
  -for libc functions, compiler calls directly
  -otherwise, load the functions from dynamic library

-Metaprogramming!
  -Implement "# StatementOrDecl" pattern to execute statements
    at parse time, and create meta-declarations
  -Implement all AST nodes as types

BACKEND
-IR rewrite:
  -Remove "print" and "assert" as instructions - make them FFI calls
  -Create parallel, simplified type system like LLVM
-All optimizations should work on the IR, without any AST

-Metaprogramming:
  -Put '#' before any pseudo-statement (scoped decls and regular statements)
    -A scoped decl after # must be variable or subroutine
      (all other scoped decls must exist in both meta world and regular program)
    -Meta-variables are different kind of name than (normal scoping applies)
    -Meta-subroutines can contain $/@-statements, regular ones can't
      -they can still be represented as Subroutine, just add 'meta' bool
    -Meta-statements are run at compile time (have no presense in final C/machine code output)
  -#define <identifier> <tokens> works just like C
    -meta-procs provide function-like macros
  -Implicit conversion from string to any AST node type is parsing

  -All meta-decls are resolved immediately after parsing
  -This triggers lazy resolution of any needed decls in non-meta space
    -If these decls are located earlier in the code, everything's fine
    -Otherwise, it's an error (name doesn't exist yet)

  -Meta built-in types and functions:
    -Have capitalized names be types representing AST nodes
    e.g. StringLit, For, Type, etc.
    -Have lowercase names be functions that take a string
    and parse it into an AST node

Example:
    Type t = type("float[][]");

  -New syntax rules:
  * (anywhere):     #<stmt>: execute meta-stmt or create meta-decl
  * (in meta-stmt): $<expr>: evaluate expr, unparse and output to code stream where the meta-stmt appeared
  * Save "@" for potential later use in metaprogramming...

  //This is a fully functional "include",
  //although real compiler should have #include
  //built in so that file/line/col works with multiple files
  //also, should actually include each file once, even if #included
  //multiple times
  #proc void include(string fname)
  {
    string text = readFile(fname);
    @text;
  }

  //C++ style generics (but with code size reduction option)
  //need keyword "generic"
  //example syntax:
  generic(T)
  func int serialSize(T val)
  {
    return serialize(val).len;
  }

  //compiler could implement by fully instantiating the decl for every type,
  //or by creating a single decl that has a union that covers all uses
  //suppose program uses:
  serialSize(int)(6);
  serialSize(string)("omgwtfbbq");
  serialSize(byte[])([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

  //there could be represented in final code by:
  func int serialSize_int__(int val)
  func int serialSize_string__(string val)
  func int serialSize_byte_arr__(byte[] val)

  //OR as:
  //argument is implicitly converted to exact match in union,
  //and if return value is a T union then extract the real value
  func int serialSize((int | string | byte[]) val)
  {
    match v : val
    {
      case int:
        return serialize(v).len;
      case string:
        return serialize(v).len;
      case byte[]:
        return serialize(v).len;
    }
  }

-----------------------------------
   After core language compiler:
-----------------------------------
BUILT-IN MODULES (all must be fully cross-platform)
  -Term (stdin/stdout/formatting/parsing, commands)
  -Sys (File I/O, filesystem, sockets, time)
  -GL (4.1+), plus some nice utilties, like:
    -GLM-style math
    -OBJ model loading
    -Shader utilities
    -Mesh utilities (half-edge structure, loading, saving)
  -Font (Unicode support, antialiasing)
  -Input (keyboard, mouse, gamepad - portable across all machines)
    -Want to be able to poll keys/buttons efficiently like SDL,
      or set callbacks for specific events
    -callbacks can be very simple with first-class subrs
  -UI through Nuklear
  -Native audio wrapper?
  -set(T) in global, implemented as (T : void)
  -Compression, for use with serialization: Zstd? (speed > compression)
  -Graph
    -Directed and not
    -Dijkstra's algo for single source reachability/distance
    -Kosaraju's algo for strongly connected components
    -topological sort
    -Prim's algo for MST
