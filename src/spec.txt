--- Obsidian Language 0.1 Specification ---

-.ob extension required
-Desired modules are #included at the top of file
-Functions can be defined in any order
-POD types are s8, s16, s32, s64, u8, u16, u32, u64
-string type is fully builtin, including operators +, = and ==
-strings are internally 1D char arrays (4-byte int for size, followed by chars)
-variables must be constant-size by default (array dimension only need to be known at runtime)
-"heap" qualifier on any variable allocates it on general purpose allocator, allowing it to be resized later
-heap has somewhat small performance cost
-non-heap variables can always be assigned directly to heap variables
-heap variables can never be assigned to non-heap variables, except in initialization at start of function
-variables can be deallocated as soon as their last use, or at the end of their scope of declaration

--- Important implementation details ---

-Internally non-int types are represented and passed as pointer-to-struct
-Use logical type promotion for basic operators (int + long = long, (float == int) compares as floats)
-Any array comparison, including string, amounts to a memcmp of all bytes (get size from one operand)
